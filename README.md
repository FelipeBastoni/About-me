I'm in the second year of my college now, and I know that I'm not that much at coding or anything...
But I think I'm trying, and I hope I can get better at it, because to me it's simply cool and interesting how all that work.
I honestly don't know if someday I will acquire a notable amount of knowledge at this...

But it seems like life insists to show me that nothing just appears in our lifes and that we have no garantee over not a single thing in this world,
So the only thing left for us is trying to learn and do   something that maybe someday will make us glad



"By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread,
till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken;
for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”
Gênesis 3:19
